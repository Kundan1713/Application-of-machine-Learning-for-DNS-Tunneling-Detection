Application of machine Learning for DNS Tunneling Detection.
Develop an effective DNS tunneling detection mechanism by gathering and processing data from two distinct Linux systems to differentiate between normal and tunneled traffic using application of machine learning.
•	Successfully orchestrated connections between Linux client and server systems for data gathering.
•	Initiated the deployment of DNS tunneling tool DNSCAT2 for capturing tunneling data, ensuring accurate representation of malicious activity.
•	Generated comprehensive reports for both normal and tunneling datasets, extracting valuable insights from data analysis.
•	Collaborated closely with the team to define project requirements and gathered data for analysis.
•	Proficiently established and maintained data packet capture from tunneling tools and Linux functions.
•	Skilfully generated normal data by leveraging NSLOOKUP servers and capturing data packets, enhancing dataset diversity for analysis.
•	Utilized advanced Pandas queries, ensuring data validation and optimizing database performance for insights.
•	Expertly led the application of machine learning techniques, implementing binary classification to distinguish between legitimate DNS requests and tunneling attempts.
